Express.js: Web framework for Node.js.
Socket.io: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
HTML/CSS: Front-end structure and styling.
JavaScript: Client-side scripting.

## How It Works
Server Setup: The server is set up using Node.js and Express.js.
Real-time Communication: Socket.io is used to handle real-time communication between the server and clients.
Client Interface: The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interface for users to join chat rooms and send messages.
Message Handling: When a user sends a message, it is broadcast to all other users in the chat room through the WebSocket connection.
